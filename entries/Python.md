# Python

Python is a programming language that can be used both for writing **command-line scripts** or building **web applications**.
**Python** is a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language "High-level programming language"), [general-purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language "General-purpose programming language"). Its design philosophy emphasizes [code readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_readability "Code readability") with the use of [significant indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule "Off-side rule").

Python is [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#DYNAMIC "Type system") and [garbage-collected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science) "Garbage collection (computer science)"). It supports multiple [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm "Programming paradigm"), including [structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming "Structured programming") (particularly [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming")), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming") and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming"). It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive [standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library "Standard library").

[Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum "Guido van Rossum") began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the [ABC programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language) "ABC (programming language)") and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely [backward-compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility") with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
