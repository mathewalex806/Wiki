# Wiki
Wiki is a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia that allows users to view and create entries on various topics.
It uses HTML as the markup language to define the structure and appearance of the web pages and 
Django, a high-level Python web framework, to handle the backend logic and database operations.
Entries are made using Markdown, a plain text formatting syntax that can be easily converted to HTML.
